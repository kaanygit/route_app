The Mevlana Mosque is a crucial structure symbolising Konya's spiritual and cultural identity. Built after the death of Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi in 1274, the mosque has also served as the centre of the Mevlevi order. Its architecture exhibits features that reflect the traces of the Seljuk period, distinguished by its elegant stonework and intricate tile decorations. Additionally, the mosque attracts significant interest from visitors due to its housing of Rumi's tomb, making it both a religious and a touristic hub. The columns and dome within the interior create a spiritual atmosphere through the play of light, allowing visitors to experience a profound emotional journey. The Mevlana Mosque has thus become one of the critical symbols not only of Konya but also of Turkey, with its architectural aesthetics and religious functionality.

The Atatürk Museum and the Olgunlaştırma Institute in Konya are significant structures representing the city's cultural heritage and educational history. The Atatürk Museum gained historical importance when the house where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stayed during his visits to Konya was transformed into a museum. Inside, personal belongings of Atatürk, photographs, and documents from the period are displayed, providing a rich resource for understanding the early years of the Turkish Republic and Atatürk's contributions to Konya. On the other hand, the Institute of Handicrafts is a crucial institution dedicated to preserving, developing, and passing down traditional arts and crafts. Mainly known for producing weaving, embroidery, and design products reflecting Konya’s cultural fabric, the institute is a support centre for local artisans and a hub for keeping Turkey’s rich handicraft culture alive. Together, these two institutions highlight Konya's historical and cultural depth, while also reflecting the local impact of educational and cultural policies that formed the foundation of modern Turkey.

The İnce Minare Taş Eserler Museum is an essential architectural structure from the Seljuk period, commissioned in 1264 by the vizier Sahip Ata Fahreddin Ali. The museum serves as a venue for showcasing stone artefacts that reflect Konya’s rich historical and cultural heritage. The İnce Minare takes its name from its elegant minaret, which draws attention with its intricately carved stonework and geometric decorations on the leading portal. The architectural design reveals the aesthetic and technical features of Seljuk art. At the same time, the museum also serves as a significant resource for tracing the development of Islamic art, epigraphy, and ornamental arts. Today, the structure, now functioning as a museum, contributes to preserving historical artefacts and their transmission to future generations.

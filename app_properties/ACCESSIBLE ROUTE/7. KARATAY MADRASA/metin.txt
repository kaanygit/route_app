The Karatay Madrasa was constructed in the 13th century as a significant example of Seljuk period architecture in Konya, built-in 1251 by Sultan IV. Kılıç Arslan, the Madrasa served as a centre for educational and cultural activities of its time. The structure embodies the elegant features of classical Seljuk architecture while also drawing attention to its intricate mosaic and tile decorations. The ornate portal at the entrance showcases some of the finest examples of Seljuk stone craftsmanship. As an institution providing education in Islamic sciences and philosophy, the Madrasa contributed to the development of prominent scholars of the period. Today, this structure, preserved through restoration efforts, attracts visitors as both an architectural heritage and a cultural memory. Beyond being an educational institution, the Karatay Medrese continues to hold significance as a vibrant representation of Seljuk art and culture.

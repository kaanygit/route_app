Şerafettin Mosque is an integral part of Konya's historical fabric and one of the unique examples of Seljuk architecture. Built in the 13th century, the mosque presents a harmonious blend of woodwork and stone craftsmanship, reflecting the artistic and cultural values of the period. The ceramic decorations in the mosque's interior stand out as a reflection of the aesthetic understanding of Islamic art, particularly the intricate craftsmanship of the mihrab, which showcases the architectural knowledge and aesthetic sensibility of the time. Furthermore, the fountain in the mosque's courtyard plays a significant role as a space for worship and a centre for social interaction. Beyond being merely a place of prayer, Şerafettin Mosque is a rich architectural and historical structure that contributes to Konya's social and cultural life.
